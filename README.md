# Hi!

The new Hi! app will allow your acquaintances to become your friends and colleagues faster.
It is an android application that creates sets of personal links to be shared through QR Code. 
If you're offline, don't worry, Hi! works offline as well, it saves the links received from your new friend in your phonebook and you can access the information whenever you want.

> As privacy is one of the concerns of Hi! the user is the one who decides which information he/she wants to share.

By creating profiles the user can choose which links are suitable for each situation.

> Hi! is integrated with Facebook so the user can easily import his/hers informantion from his/hers public profile.

This is not another phonebook app, it is integrated with your smartphone contacts so all your contacts kept in a single place.

> Hi! is perfect for situations in which you need to share information quickly and securely.
